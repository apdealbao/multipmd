# multipmd
Multiple-path-metadynamics (MultiPMD) and PathMaps.

1. MultiPMD applied to sample two C7eq-to-C7ax paths in alanine dipeptide
2. PMD with an attractor applied to sample an intermediate path between the two C7eq-to-C7ax paths in alanine dipeptide found in 1.
3. CyclePMD applied to sample a C7eq-to-C7ax-to-C7eq path in alanine dipeptide
4. MultiPMD applied to sample six PP1-to-PP2 paths in tetrameric polyproline
5. PathMap applied to the six PP1-to-PP2 paths found in 4.
